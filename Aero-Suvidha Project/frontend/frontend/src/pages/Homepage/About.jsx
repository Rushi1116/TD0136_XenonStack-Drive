                            Tourism is travel for pleasure; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating,
                            and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Travelling may be international, or within the
                            traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the
                            common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in
                            places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other
                            purposes".

                            Travel can be domestic or international, and international travel has both incoming and outgoing implications on
                            a country's balance of payments. Aero-Suvidha has stayed ahead of the curve by continually evolving its technology to meet the ever-changing demands of the rapidly developing global travel market, steadily establishing itself as Indiaâ€™s leading online travel company.
